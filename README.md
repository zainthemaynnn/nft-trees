# NFTrees

this leverages the *card store* template to create a an app where you can mint an `NFTree`

*NFTrees* give you ownership over a tree which is planted in a random location around the world. it uses an NFT-drop system with a precomputed set of 7433 trees and an increasing serial number for each mint. some trees in a specific genus are more valuable than others.

obviously, the locations and species don't match up; they're only for proof of concept. funds go towards environmental causes.
